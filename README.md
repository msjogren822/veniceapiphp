<strong>Venice.ai API example PHP script</strong><br>
This is a simple 1-page script using php, javascript and HTML to acces about 6 open-source AI models available on the Venice.ai platform.

There is really nothing special you need to know. Just sign up for an API key or to go to the site, please use my referral link... <a href="https://venice.ai/chat?ref=aHYnVr" target="_blank">https://venice.ai/chat?ref=aHYnVr</a>

If people express an interest in this, I may expand on it and integrate it into the WordPress platform. It can currently function as a custom template but I could see adding database connectivity to save prompts.

Here is a working example... <a href="https://dothink.great-site.net/merged_venny.php" target="_blank">https://dothink.great-site.net/merged_venny.php</a> It may disappear or I may throttle it if the API gets costly from traffic.

Happy generating!
